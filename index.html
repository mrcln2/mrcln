<h2 style="color:black; text-shadow:2px 2px green;text-align: left;">ABOUT ME:</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;font-family: arial;color: gray;"> I am <b style="color:darkslategray;">Marclean</b>, an 18-year-old first-year college student currently taking up <b style="color:darkslategray;">Bachelor of Science in Information Systems</b>. Every day, I travel two hours to attend classes, starting my mornings as early as 5:00 AM. Despite the long commute, I remain motivated and eager to pursue my studies because I know it will help me achieve my future goals in the field of technology and information systems. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;font-family: arial;color: gray;">Aside from academics, I have a strong passion for sports, especially <i>volleyball</i>. Playing on the court helps me stay active, build teamwork, and develop discipline both inside and outside the classroom. <i>Sports also serve as my outlet whenever I feel stressed, keeping me balanced as a student.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;font-family: arial;color: gray;">In my free time, I enjoy working on simple web projects using <b style="color:darkslategray;">HTML</b> and exploring how websites are built. Creating websites has become one of my favorite hobbies because it allows me to combine creativity with technical skills. As I continue my journey in college, I look forward to learning more about programming, systems, and design while also growing as a person</p>

<br>

<h2 style="color:black; text-shadow:2px 2px green;text-align: left;">SKILLS:</h2>

<p style="text-align: justify;font-family: arial;color: gray;">I have a strong foundation in technology and information systems, with basic skills in HTML and CSS for website creation and a working knowledge of Microsoft Office applications such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint. I also possess an understanding of database concepts and have the ability to troubleshoot simple computer and mobile issues.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;font-family: arial;color: gray;">Beyond technical abilities, I value time management, adaptability, and quick learning, which I developed through balancing my studies with long daily commutes. I also practice teamwork and leadership through playing volleyball, where discipline and cooperation are essential both on and off the court.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;font-family: arial;color: gray;">In addition, I am creative and resourceful when it comes to handling tasks and projects. I enjoy problem-solving and applying analytical thinking, whether in academics or personal activities. I also bring with me strong communication skills in both English and Filipino, making me effective in collaborating and connecting with others.
